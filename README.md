Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Requirements

We support:

* OS X Grand Sierra (10.13)
* OS X Mojave (10.14)
* OS X Catalina (10.15)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

## Install

Download, review, then execute the script:

```bash
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimbl3/laptop/master/mac
less mac
bash mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

## Debugging

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/nimbl3/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

## Customize in `~/.laptop.local`

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh


cask dropbox
cask firefox

brew 'tree'
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`,
`brew_install_or_upgrade`, and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.

## Contributing

Edit the `mac` file.
Document in the `README.md` file.
